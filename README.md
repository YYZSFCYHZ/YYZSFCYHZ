Hi, Iâ€™m @YYZSFCYHZ

Currently getting back into Python but my favourites also include C++, SQL, and PowerShell.

Over the years I've done a lot in DOS/Windows batch, VBS, some small tools in BASH, and lots of configuration with PowerShell. 

I've had brief acquaintances with PowerBuilder, Delphi, C++ Builder, and long run with Visual Basic 3 and 6 with seques into VBA.

My love of code began in 1984 with BASIC on a TRS-8- CoCo II. It was painful and I have no delusions about going back.

High school gave me infrequent access to Turbo Pascal on an Apple IIe.

1990 brought a Tandy RLX-1000. An AMD 286 CPU @ 12Mhz with MSDOS 5 and QBASIC.
 
 
How to reach me ...

You don't.

Yet.
